# NeuroLink Frontend Documentation

## Overview
The frontend of the NeuroLink project is designed to provide an intuitive user interface for interacting with brainwave data and visualizing real-time information. This documentation outlines the key features and design principles of the frontend application.

## User Interface Design
The user interface is built with a focus on usability and accessibility. Key components include:

- **Dashboard**: A central hub for users to view their brainwave data and insights.
- **Visualization Tools**: Real-time graphs and charts that display brainwave activity.
- **User Controls**: Options for users to customize their experience and settings.

## Real-Time Visualization Features
The frontend leverages advanced visualization techniques to present brainwave data in an engaging manner. Features include:

- **Dynamic Graphs**: Live updates of brainwave patterns as data is received.
- **Interactive Elements**: Users can interact with visualizations to gain deeper insights.
- **Data Filtering**: Options to filter data based on specific parameters or time frames.

## Technologies Used
The frontend is developed using modern web technologies, including:

- **HTML/CSS**: For structure and styling of the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic content and interactivity.
- **Frameworks**: Utilization of frameworks such as React or Vue.js for efficient UI development.
