# AI Models Documentation

## Overview
The AI Models folder contains the algorithms and models used for interpreting brainwave data and generating creative outputs based on that data. This documentation provides an overview of the models implemented, their purposes, and how to utilize them within the NeuroLink project.

## Brainwave Interpretation
The brainwave interpretation algorithms analyze the incoming EEG data to identify patterns and states of mind. These algorithms are designed to classify brainwave activity into various categories, which can be used for further processing or visualization.

## Creative Output Generation
Based on the interpreted brainwave data, the creative output generation models create unique outputs, such as art, music, or other forms of media. These models leverage machine learning techniques to produce results that reflect the user's mental state and preferences.

## Usage
To use the AI models in your application, ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and configured. Refer to the specific model documentation for details on input formats, expected outputs, and example usage.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the AI models, please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the main README.md file of the NeuroLink project. Your contributions can help improve the accuracy and creativity of the outputs generated by the models.
