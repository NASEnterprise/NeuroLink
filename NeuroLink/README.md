# NeuroLink Project

NeuroLink is an innovative project aimed at integrating brain-computer interface (BCI) technology with artificial intelligence to interpret brainwave data and generate creative outputs. This project is structured into several key components, each serving a specific purpose in the overall architecture.

## Project Structure

- **backend**: Contains the logic for brainwave data processing and AI integration.
- **frontend**: Responsible for the user interface and real-time visualization of brainwave data.
- **bci-integration**: Manages the connection to EEG devices and handles data flow.
- **ai-models**: Includes algorithms for brainwave interpretation and creative output generation.
- **exports**: Handles the saving and management of user creations.
