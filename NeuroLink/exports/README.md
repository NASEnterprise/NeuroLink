# Exports Documentation

This folder is dedicated to managing user creations generated through the NeuroLink application. 

## Overview

The `exports` folder contains all the necessary files and data related to the outputs produced by users during their interaction with the NeuroLink system. This includes saved brainwave interpretations, creative outputs, and any other relevant artifacts.

## Saving User Creations

When a user completes a session or generates a creative output, the application will automatically save the results in this directory. The saved files will typically include:

- **Brainwave Interpretation Files**: These files contain the processed brainwave data and the corresponding interpretations.
- **Creative Output Files**: These files represent the creative outputs generated based on the brainwave data, which may include images, music, or other forms of media.

## File Management

Users can access their saved creations directly from this folder. It is recommended to organize files by date or session for easier retrieval. The application may also provide functionality to delete or rename files as needed.

## Future Enhancements

Future updates may include features for exporting user creations to different formats or integrating with external storage solutions for better accessibility and sharing options.
